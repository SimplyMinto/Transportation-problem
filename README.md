## Introduction to the Transportation Problem
The transportation problem is a way to figure out the best way to move goods from where they're produced to where they're needed, while keeping costs as low as possible.
### What is the Transportation Problem?
Imagine you have several factories that produce goods and several stores that need those goods. The transportation problem helps you decide how much to ship from each factory to each store in a way that minimizes the total cost.
<ul type= "Disk">
<li><b>Sources (Factories)</b>: Places where goods are made. Each has a certain amount of goods available.</li>
<li><b>Destinations (Stores)</b>: Places where goods are needed. Each needs a certain amount of goods.</li>
<li><b>Cost Matrix</b>: A table showing how much it costs to ship one unit of goods from each factory to each store.</li>
<li><b>Objective</b>: Ship the goods in a way that costs the least while making sure all the factories' supplies and all the stores' demands are met.</li></ul>

### Why Use the Transportation Problem?
<ul type= "Disk">
<li><b>Save Money</b>: The main goal is to reduce shipping costs, which can save a lot of money.</li>
<li><b>Use Resources Wisely</b>: It makes sure that the resources (both goods and transport) are used efficiently.</li>
<li><b>Better Decisions</b>: Helps businesses make smarter decisions about how to move goods</li>
<li><b>Improve Logistics</b>: Aids in planning and managing the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries.</li></ul>

## Conclusion
The transportation problem is a key method in logistics and supply chain management, helping businesses save money and use resources efficiently. By solving this problem, companies can optimize their distribution networks and improve overall efficiency.
